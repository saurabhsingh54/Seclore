Messenger App
Your application is divided into three parts
1. Client -> main method
2. Application class -> will call the pojo and other classes
3. Pojo classes -> POJO and business logic 

We have to create the messaging app which allow you
to send messages in specific type.
Available type : 1. SMS message 2. Email 3.Courier 



allow user to make a choice to send message by providing  option to choose the message type where inputs are ::  to (address) and message body

i.e. method :: sendMessage(String to , String message)

Note : Your application have to accept changes. in case of new type of message is introduce in 
future there should be no issues to intigrate the same.
